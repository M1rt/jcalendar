# JCalendar
JCalendar is a Java date chooser bean for graphically picking a date. JCalendar is composed of several other Java beans, a JDayChooser, a JMonthChooser and a JYearChooser. All these beans have a locale property, provide several icons (Color 16×16, Color 32×32, Mono 16×16 and Mono 32×32) and their own locale property editor. So they can easily be used in GUI builders. Also part of the package is a JDateChooser, a bean composed of an IDateEditor (for direct date editing) and a button for opening a JCalendar for selecting the date.

This is a fork of the archived JCalendar project developed by [toedter](https://github.com/toedter/jcalendar) which stopped being maintained. Now JCalendar supports new technologies introduced from Java 8.
